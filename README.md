# ESP-IDF Project Template with CI and Hardware Testing

This is a template project to be used as a reference for ESP-IDF projects with GitHub CI.

![GitHub Workflow Status](https://github.com/espressif/gh-esp-test-template/actions/workflows/ci_workflow.yml/badge.svg)

The purpose of this project is to provide a good **starting point for customers who are developing an application based on Espressif chips and want to run unit or integration tests on real hardware.**

*You can fork and update this project according to your specific needs.*

> Note: As default, the hardware testting job is `disabled`. To enable it, please see the **How to Setup** documents.

## Documentation

In this example project, we will set up the necessary hardware for testing as well as the GitHub Action CI workflow.

![GitHub Action Workflow map](docs/imgs/ghub_action_workflow.svg)

Your application code will be automatically tested on real hardware (Espressif chips) in a scheduled workflow (nightly build), if changes are pushed to your repository, or you can run the tests manually.
